I am a third-year undergraduate student at [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://nuaa.edu.cn/), majoring in [Aircraft Design and Engineering](https://aero.nuaa.edu.cn/). My research interests lie in robotics mechanics, hardware circuits, machine learning, and reinforcement learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Lecturer [Haochen Shi](https://www.linkedin.cn/incareer/in/haochen-shi-1975b017b) from the [School of Public Experimental Teaching Department](https://fetd.nuaa.edu.cn/) at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

I have participated in several projects, including [the National University Engineering Practice and Innovation Competition](http://gcxl.edu.cn/new/index.html) (my team earned a silver award in the temperature difference vehicle track) and a National College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program focused on developing an intelligent chess game robot system based on a three-axis gantry slide.
