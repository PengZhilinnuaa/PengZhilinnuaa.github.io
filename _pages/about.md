I'm a third year undergraduate student from [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://nuaa.edu.cn/), majoring in [Aircraft Design and Engineering](https://aero.nuaa.edu.cn/). My research interests includes robot mechanics and hardware circuit, machine learning, and reinforcement learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Lecturer Shi Haochen](https://ee.nuaa.edu.cn/) from the [School of Public Experimental Teaching Department]([https://ee.nuaa.edu.cn/](https://fetd.nuaa.edu.cn/)) at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

I have participated in several projects, such as [the National University Engineering Practice and Innovation Competition](http://gcxl.edu.cn/new/index.html) (silver award in the temperature difference vehicle track) and a National College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program on an intelligent chess game robot system based on a four-axis gantry slide.
